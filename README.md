# Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Text Classification

## Overview
This project classifies text data (e.g., emails, articles) into categories using machine learning models. Techniques like TF-IDF and Naive Bayes are applied.

## Objectives:
- Build a classifier to detect spam messages.
- Preprocess the text data using NLP techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK
- Naive Bayes
- TF-IDF

## Key Insights
- Classified text into multiple categories with high accuracy.
- Preprocessed text data using NLP techniques like tokenization and lemmatization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to classify text data.
